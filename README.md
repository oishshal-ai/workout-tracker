## Motivation
As an athlete and developer, I wanted to combine my passion for training with my programming journey. I train for water polo and rock climbing through a combination of swimming, water polo practice, climbing, and weight training. This project demonstrates full-stack skills while allowing tracking of unique aspects of each type of training.
